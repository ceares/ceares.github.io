##### [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
 
##### [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/)

VISUALIZE Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, C, and C++ programs 

Python Tutor, created by Philip Guo, helps people overcome a fundamental barrier to learning programming: understanding what happens as the computer executes each line of a program's source code.

Using this tool, you can write Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, C, and C++ programs in your Web browser and visualize what the computer is doing step-by-step as it executes those programs. So far, over 1.5 million people in over 180 countries have used Python Tutor to visualize over 15 million pieces of code, often as a supplement to textbooks, lecture notes, and online programming tutorials.
