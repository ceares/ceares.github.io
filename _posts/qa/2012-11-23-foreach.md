\begin{document}
\def\lastx{10}
\foreach \x[count=\xi from 2,remember=\x as \lastx] in {15,19,20,25} {
This variable \x, the value before was \lastx\space  and it is the argument \xi\space in the list.\par}

This variable 19, the value before was 15 and it is the argument 3 in the list.  
This variable 20, the value before was 19 and it is the argument 4 in the list.
